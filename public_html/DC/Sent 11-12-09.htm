<DIV><SPAN class=408144823-12112009><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial>I can 
certainly understand your frustration, but I can assure you that the 
transformers were tested for shorts before being re-used.&nbsp; The finished 
module was completely tested for proper operation and verified to operate to 
specification.&nbsp; If there had been 22V common mode on the output, we would 
have found it.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

<DIV><SPAN class=408144823-12112009><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial>Since you're 
still experiencing the same symptom, my first suggestion would be to verify that 
your wiring harness is correct and the proper voltages are appearing at the 
right pins on the power connector.&nbsp; The smoking R40 is a big clue that 
something's not right in your harness, since the module ran on the bench for an 
extended period with no such problems.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

  <DIV>&nbsp;I understand the concept of denying liability, but to do so here is 
  thoroughly insulting. This is the order of events that occurred:<BR><BR><BR>1. 
  Packaged arrive in mail<BR><BR>2. Package was opened and N72 module 
  removed<BR><BR>3. N72 module was installed straight in SCA build chassis and 
  connected to SCA build power supply<BR>4. mic was connected to N72 XLR in, XLR 
  -&gt; TRS connected N72's line-out to API a2d line-in<BR>5. device was powered 
  on<BR>6. burning smell commenced, smoke came from N72 (R40 burning up), and 
  LED graphs on API a2d went haywire<BR>7. Both devices were shut 
  off<BR><BR><BR>And after that, I replaced R40 and check the XLR output and 
  discovered that voltage was still present there. Unless you're saying that 
  there's a magnetic field somewhere along the way from SCA to my house that 
  specifically targets and disrupts N72 modules, causing them to possess DC on 
  their outputs, it's very clear that the N72 arrived at my house with the exact 
  same malfunction that it had when I shipped it to you because it left from SCA 
  with that malfunction still intact. And since the board was a rebuild, it 
  seems logical that the problem carried over from a problem part that was 
  re-used... the transformer. If this board was indeed tested, then that testing 
  did not include testing for the problem which it was previously afflicted 
  with, which is DC on the output.<BR><BR><BR>- David

    <DIV><BR>Hi,<BR>I've received the N72 back, however, the exact same problem 
    of DC on the output still persists. I take it you put the transformer from 
    my previous build on to this new board, which would explain things. This 
    also means that you did not test or even power on the N72 before shipping it 
    back to me. This also means that I just paid you $175 due to a misdiagnosis 
    on your part and that there was indeed nothing wrong with my build in the 
    first place, that the problem all along was a faulty output 
    transformer.<BR><BR>I have an A12 I built running on the same SCA built 
    power supply, and it runs problem free.<BR><BR>For reference, this is what I 
    heard shortly after turning on the N72, while recording through my a2d's 
    line-in:<BR>http://www.mediafire.com/file/znjzzmgzw0y/DC noise.mp3<BR><BR>I 
    also smelled a strong burning smell coming from the vicinity. I immediately 
    shut both devices off as quickly as I could get out of my chair and over to 
    them. When I later powered the a2d back one, there was this buzzing noise 
    present in all 
    recordings:<BR><BR>http://www.mediafire.com/file/dzm3myzdzlz/api 
    a2d.wav<BR><BR>I turned the a2d off again and left it for a few hours. When 
    I powered it back on, that buzzing noise had disappeared, but that does not 
    mean there are any damages. I will have to have a look at it to see, and if 
    there are any, they are the responsibility of SCA.<BR><BR>Attached is also a 
    photo of the reading that comes from the output on the N72.<BR><BR><BR>I 
    would like a working preamp, and I would also like *at least* half of the 
    money I paid for an unnecessary rebuild - one that is fully the 
    responsibility of SCA because 1: SCA initially supplied me with a faulty 
    transformer which should have been immediately replaced free of charge and 
    2: SCA's misdiagnosis of the problem is its own responsibility and fault - 
    returned to me.<BR><BR>Further, I now have to examine my API a2d for damages 
    which might have been caused by connecting the N72 to its line-in before I 
    was aware that there was still DC on the output. If there are repair costs 
    incurred due to this, I will pass them along to SCA.<BR><BR><BR>I seek 
    speedy resolve of this issue. Sincerely,<BR><BR><BR><BR>-
