<br><br><div>&nbsp;<BR></div><br><br><br><br>&gt; From: sales@seventhcircleaudio.com<br>&gt; To: delicieuxz@hotmail.com<br>&gt; Subject: RE: N72 module<br>&gt; Date: Mon, 28 Dec 2009 08:22:52 -0800<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Hello David,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Glad to hear you received the module.  Some answers to your questions are<br>&gt; below.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; This still leaves the issue of $175 which I paid to have the item<br>&gt; &gt; rebuilt in response to what turned out to be a mis-diagnosis,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; As you can see on our "repairs" page<br>&gt; (http://www.seventhcircleaudio.com/repairs.htm), our fixed-price repair<br>&gt; policy has nothing to do with making a diagnosis.  If we work on an N72,<br>&gt; it's $185.  Please note that we didn't charge to correct the botched<br>&gt; resistor replacement we found when we got the rebuilt module back.<br><br><br>Is this a bad joke, or are you the joke? A higher watt interim resistor was installed in place so that I could take measurements with it powered on without the resistor burning up. Are you new to electronics? Of course not. So don't say stupid things that show you're attempting to play your customer for a fool.<br>In addition, why would you charge me for a 15 cent resistor that only burnt because you sent back to me a module with a faulty transformer? Seriously, was your head not on straight when you wrote that?<br><br><br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; when the only problem all along was that I had originally<br>&gt; &gt; received a kit with a faulty output transformer.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; All of the Carnhill transformers we ship are tested for shorts and opens at<br>&gt; the factory and again by us.  At this point it's impossible to know if the<br>&gt; intermittent short we eventually found was due to a manufacturing defect,<br>&gt; shipping damage, or rough handling during assembly.<br><br><br>The transformer was DOA for a fact.<br>It wouldn't even make a difference if the problem had arisen from rough shipping - though this scenario can be discounted because there were no signs of such on the box (which I re-used to ship it back to you the 2nd time) and the padding on the inside was more than enough to protect it against anything that could have occurred without blemishing the box itself.<br>The product was certainly not handled roughly from the moment I received it, the clear answer is that I received a faulty transformer from the get-go. Your customer service skills are about non-existent, but your weaseling skills are extreme.<br><br><br>&gt; <br>&gt; &gt; It would be extremely bizarre to me if I was expected to bear a<br>&gt; &gt; penalty for having received a defective kit, the loss of its use<br>&gt; &gt; for the long time while it remained defective, and the<br>&gt; &gt; mis-diagnosis that occurred before the problem was resolved -<br>&gt; &gt; despite my even mentioning on the 7th Circle forums that I<br>&gt; &gt; thought the problem was the transformer.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; If you had determined the transformer was shorted, you could have returned<br>&gt; it for a replacement.  From my reading of this thread<br>&gt; (http://seventhcirclestudios.com/SCA/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=1538), it sounds<br>&gt; like you had the module for months without being able to determine the cause<br>&gt; of the symptom.  Despite the inconvenience of having to send it in twice,<br>&gt; for which I apologize, you now have a working N72 which should deliver years<br>&gt; of service, instead of an incomplete and disappointing project.<br><br><br>I DID return the module for a transformer check and replacement if needed - which it was. That I had the module in my possession a while before the source of the problem was pinpointed makes total difference of none to the responsibility you bear to having sent my a defective kit, and the expenses invoked along the path to correcting your error. I have all email correspondence between us saved. My first email to you mentions that I am seeking a transformer replacement if that is the problem, but you didn't examine the transformer properly and instead requested a board rebuild. I stated: "If it's a faulty transformer then I don't think I should be paying for that," but you demanded that it's either a complete board reworking or nothing: "we're not going to do any further troubleshooting unless we can rework the entire board.&nbsp; If you'd rather continue troubleshooting on your own, we'd be happy to return the module." You screwed up. You owe me that money back, and should even go further to make reparations for the mess you caused.<br><br>I have unfortunately had an EXTREMELY disappointing project, because, for one thing, I was given a faulty kit. Then, it took forever to discover the problem. Then, the module was sent in to fix the problem, and instead of that occurring, I was charged for a completely worthless and un-necessary rebuild... which took THREE MONTHS... while leaving the problem intact. Finally, the problem was addressed, but you shirk your responsibility for sending me a defective kit in the first place and attempt to put the onus on me. If you ever received such shit treatment from a retailer, you would be furious, as I am with you. You do not deserve to be in business, and I am changing my previous recommendations of your products to warnings to stay away from SCA. I will be extremely vocal about my experience with you if you do not make right your error and refund my $175.<br><br><br>I'm amazed at the lack of professionalism regarding customer service. That rebuild was done only because you demanded it had to be, otherwise you would not do anything further with the module. If you had just tested the output transformer the problem would have been resolved. The rebuild did nothing to improve the module, and didn't lead to you fixing the output transformer. You should take responsibility for your mistake, and even apologize to me for the inconvenience it has caused me. <br><br><br><br>&gt; If you have further questions, please let me know.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Best regards,<br>&gt; <br>&gt; Tim Ryan<br><br><br>I don't have questions, I have a statement. You, Tim Ryan, OWE ME $175 USD for your screw up, which is sending me a defective kit and erroneously blaming the module not working on the build.<br><br><br>- David<br> 		 	   		  <br /><hr />Windows Live: Keep your friends up to date <a href='http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9691810' target='_new'>with what you do online.</a>
