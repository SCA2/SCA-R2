<DIV><SPAN class=019215120-09112009><FONT color=#0000ff face=Arial>Sorry to hear 
that you're still experiencing difficulties.&nbsp; I assure you that the module 
was tested completely, including differential and common mode voltages at the 
output, and was performing normally when we shipped it.&nbsp; Also, we test all 
of the Carnhill transformers for shorts before including them in kits.&nbsp; 
Please send the module back and we'll have another look at it.&nbsp; I'd be 
happy to reimburse you for shipping, or we can arrange for a UPS pickup at an 
address of your choosing.</FONT></SPAN></DIV>

  Ready<BR><BR></FONT></DIV><BR><BR>
  <DIV><BR>Hi,<BR>I've received the N72 back, however, the exact same problem of 
  DC on the output still persists. I take it you put the transformer from my 
  previous build on to this new board, which would explain things. This also 
  means that you did not test or even power on the N72 before shipping it back 
  to me. This also means that I just paid you $175 due to a misdiagnosis on your 
  part and that there was indeed nothing wrong with my build in the first place, 
  that the problem all along was a faulty output transformer.<BR><BR>I have an 
  A12 I built running on the same SCA built power supply, and it runs problem 
  free.<BR><BR>For reference, this is what I heard shortly after turning on the 
  N72, while recording through my a2d's 
  line-in:<BR>http://www.mediafire.com/file/znjzzmgzw0y/DC noise.mp3<BR><BR>I 
  also smelled a strong burning smell coming from the vicinity. I immediately 
  shut both devices off as quickly as I could get out of my chair and over to 
  them. When I later powered the a2d back one, there was this buzzing noise 
  present in all 
  recordings:<BR><BR>http://www.mediafire.com/file/dzm3myzdzlz/api 
  a2d.wav<BR><BR>I turned the a2d off again and left it for a few hours. When I 
  powered it back on, that buzzing noise had disappeared, but that does not mean 
  there are any damages. I will have to have a look at it to see, and if there 
  are any, they are the responsibility of SCA.<BR><BR>Attached is also a photo 
  of the reading that comes from the output on the N72.<BR><BR><BR>I would like 
  a working preamp, and I would also like *at least* half of the money I paid 
  for an unnecessary rebuild - one that is fully the responsibility of SCA 
  because 1: SCA initially supplied me with a faulty transformer which should 
  have been immediately replaced free of charge and 2: SCA's misdiagnosis of the 
  problem is its own responsibility and fault - returned to me.<BR><BR>Further, 
  I now have to examine my API a2d for damages which might have been caused by 
  connecting the N72 to its line-in before I was aware that there was still DC 
  on the output. If there are repair costs incurred due to this, I will pass 
  them along to SCA.<BR><BR><BR>I seek speedy resolve of this issue. 
  Sincerely,<BR><BR><BR><BR>- David<BR><BR></DIV><BR><BR><BR><BR>&gt; From:
